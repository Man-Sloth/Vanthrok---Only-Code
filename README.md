# Vanthrok - Only Code
 Upload of just the code of Vanthrok, an mmorpg isometric game I'm currently developing. Players can connect to a dedicated server through gateway and authentication servers before being connected to the game server to keep player's information safe. 

 Players can currently create a player and have 4 saved to the server. All logic and data is stored server side to prevent cheating. It is capable of handling up to 4,095 connected users per game server. We are attempting to fake a 3D isometric view of the characters with 2D sprites including real time lighting.
